# Moon and Tides 

A RPi Zero & 3D printed project. 

You'll find the code, 3D models, and instructions for building here. 


## Requirements



## Todo

- Function(s) to get and store the next high or low tide on boot. Tides are periodic (avg. 24h 50m 30s - (ref)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_clock])
  - Or get tides via API with more data: https://api.marea.ooo/doc/v2#overview
- Function to get the current phase of the moon (develop in house or Moon API: https://moon-api.com)
- Design display screens for high and low tide
- Build a function to switch between moon and tide in the globe
- Build a function to rotate the occlusion half dome to the correct location based on the current moon phase
- Multiple network: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/11631/how-to-setup-multiple-wifi-networks
